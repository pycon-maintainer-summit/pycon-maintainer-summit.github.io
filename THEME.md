# Popular: an Astro theme for meetups & communities

> *Built to make your community seen and famous.* (Yes, it's named after *Pop!ular* by Darren Hayes.)

> **AI agents / automated contributors:** read [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) before making changes. It covers the repo layout, build commands, the Hugo-Astro parity contract, and content conventions.

**Popular** is a warm, community-first [Astro](https://astro.build) theme for meetups, user
groups and small events: the Astro twin of
[`hugo-theme-popular`](../hugo-theme-popular). Both share the same design tokens, CSS,
behaviour JS and content model; see **PARITY.md** for the cross-repo contract.

- Composable **home page** (hero, stats, features, auto next-event, latest posts, organizers, testimonials, CTA)
- **Blog** with tag filtering, tag pages, RSS, and per-post speaker bios
- **Events** that automatically split into *upcoming* and *past*
- **Organizers / team** page
- **Docs** (handbook & runbooks) with scroll-spy TOC and **checklists that remember progress**
- Dark footer with **land-acknowledgement** slot and social links
- **Alt text, required**: CI builds every site and fails if any image lacks alt text
- **Agent & human friendly**: ships [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) so AI coding agents follow the same rules as human contributors
- **Translatable UI**: every template string lives in one place (Hugo `i18n/`, Astro `STRINGS` config), so a site can run in any language
- Re-brand the whole theme from `src/config.ts`, no CSS edits needed

**Full documentation** lives on the theme's product site (deployed from the Hugo
repo): start at `/docs/quick-start/?fw=astro`. This README covers the essentials.

**Multi-author blogging:** posts support `authors: ["slug"]` (profiles in
`src/content/authors/` with bio, photo, socials, website → linked profile pages)
and inline `guestAuthors` for one-off guest writers, plus a plain `author` string fallback.

## Quick start

```bash
npm install
npm run dev          # http://localhost:4321
npm run build        # static output in dist/
```

The repo ships **four complete fictional demos** sharing the same theme code:
**Rocky Cove Aquarium Club** (teal), **Lucky Town Foodie Club** (copper),
**KDrama Fan Club** (indigo) and **Truly Madly Riley** (gold, a personal site
for one fictional superfan). Switch the active demo with `npm run demo:foodie`
/ `demo:kdrama` / `demo:aquarium` / `demo:superfan` (copies `demos/<slug>/`
into `src/` + `public/images`). The deploy workflow publishes all four behind a
gallery landing page with an in-page switcher (`DEMO_BAR` in `src/config.ts`, 
set it to `null` on a real site and it never appears). All communities and venues
in the demos are made up for demonstration.

## Make it yours

| What | Where |
|---|---|
| Site name, logo, tagline, land acknowledgement | `src/config.ts` → `SITE` |
| Colours, fonts, radii (design tokens) | `src/config.ts` → `BRAND` (deep changes: `src/styles/tokens/`) |
| Navigation, header CTA, footer, socials | `src/config.ts` → `NAV`, `CTA`, `FOOTER`, `SOCIAL` |
| Home page sections | `src/config.ts` → `HOME` |
| Blog posts / events / organizers | `src/content/{blog,events,organizers}/*.md` |
| About, Code of Conduct, Get involved | `src/content/pages/*.mdx` |
| Handbook & runbooks | `src/content/docs/*.mdx` (use `<Callout>` and `<Checklist>`); sidebar ordered by `weight`, set it on every docs page |

Front-matter schemas live in `src/content.config.ts` (zod-validated) and are kept
1:1 compatible with the Hugo theme, so content moves between the two freely.

### MDX components

```mdx
import Callout from '../../components/Callout.astro';
import Checklist from '../../components/Checklist.astro';

<Callout tone="tip" title="Two-deep rule">
  Aim for **two** organizers at every event.
</Callout>

<Checklist id="rb-venue" items={[
  'Shortlist 2–3 venues',
  'Confirm step-free access',
]} />
```

`Checklist` progress persists in the visitor's browser (`localStorage`), using the same
key format as the Hugo theme.

## Deploying

Static output: deploy `dist/` to Netlify, GitHub Pages, Cloudflare Pages, etc.
Set `site` in `astro.config.mjs` for correct RSS/OG URLs.

## Support the theme

Popular is free and MIT licensed. If it made your community site easier, there are three
ways to support the work:

- **Star the repo** so other organizers can find it
- **Tell others about it**: share it with another meetup, club or community, or use it
  yourself for your next community site
- **[Sponsor on GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/Mariatta)**
